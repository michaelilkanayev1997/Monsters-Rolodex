# Monsters-Rolodex

This is my first project in React. 
It's a single page that allows the user to search through different Cards of monsters whose information is taken from an internet source.
The goal of this project was to learn the basics of React.
This page was made at first with Class-Component and then exactly the same page was made with Functional-Component.
